# Great Time Simulator (UnderFell Sans Fight)
This project is a clone of the sans fight from [UnderFell](http://underfell.tumblr.com).
It was made with [Construct 2](https://www.scirra.com/construct2).

NOW AVAILABLE! [Custom attacks guide](Documentation/README.MD)
-----------------------------------------------------

Known Issues
------------
- Heart hitbox is probably not accurate.
- On the sans_platforms4 and sans_platforms4hard attacks, the platform is supposed to accelerate from 0 to its full speed, but I was lazy and started it at full speed immediately. This is only a problem if you try to dodge the bones without jumping.
- Sans dialog is missing. I may add something at some future date, but I have no intention of putting the original text in, as it really only makes sense in the context of the whole game.
